# Hello-Everyone-
My name is Daniel and I am a Junior Front-End Web Developer with over 1 year experience. I work with a variety of technologies, these being ✅HTML5, ✅CSS3, ✅Bootstrap, ✅W3C validator and in the future I want to master more programming languages, for example ❓JavaScript, ❓PHP and ❓WordPress. The key to its success is to build compatible websites for each cross-browser, for example ✅IE7 +, ireFirefox, ✅Opera, ✅Safari and ✅Chrome. The writing of the code should be clean and orderly and the observance of the dead time of each project. Since I work, I convert PSD, PNG, JPG files into actual sites

I like to wark from home !
